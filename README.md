# HapticKeypad
A jailbreak tweak to provide haptics in Phone.app on iOS 11.3.1

By hooking into the methods used by Phone.app when entering and deleting characters (as well as pressing the call button), I'm able to trigger a `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` to invoke haptic feedback. This tweak was requested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/8yx3r2/request_haptic_feedback_when_entering_numbers_on/) by [u/cultomo
